This directory should contain the eclipse platforms that should be used as the basis for your distribution.

The hierarchy should be : <version>/<os>/<platform>/eclipse*.zip
Examples : 
- 4.4.1/win32/x86_64/eclipse-platform-4.4.1-win32-x86_64.zip
- 4.4.1/macosx-cocoa/x86_64/eclipse-platform-4.4.1-macosx-cocoa-x86_64.tar.gz

If several target plaforms exist, as many distributions will be created.
